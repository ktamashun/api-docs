		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>IBM Cloud Video Player SDK for tvOS provides an API to play all kinds of IBM Cloud Video content on Apple Tv.
		Using this native SDK gives you full control over the Player, including a customizable native user interface, callbacks on status changes, and many more.
		(Note: if you need none of the above, you may use the HTML-based <a href="https://github.com/ustream/embedapi/blob/master/README.md">Player API</a> instead)</p>
		<p>This document describes the basic steps to make an app using the Player SDK for tvOS.</p>
		<h3 id="introduction-supported">Supported tvOS versions</h3>
		<p>IBM Cloud Video Player SDK for tvOS requires Xcode 7.1, targeting tvOS 9.0 or above.</p>
		<h3 id="introdcution-contents">Contents of the Package</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><b>TvOSPlayerSDK.framework</b> - the framework itself, containing a flat binary including architectures: x86_64 arm64</li>
			<li><b>tvOSPlayerSDKSample</b> - a sample application using the IBM Cloud Video Player SDK for tvOS</li>
		</ul>
	</section>

		<h2>Integration</h2>
		<h3 id="integration-step1">Step 1: Adding the framework to your project.</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Unzip the package and copy the Framework directory into your project’s source directory.</li>
			<li>Add the framework to your project from Xcode.</li>
			<li>Make sure that <b>TvOSPlayerSDK.framework</b> is included into <b>Target Settings/Build Phases/Link Binary With Libraries</b></li>
			<li>Make sure that <b>Target Settings/Build Settings/Framework Search Paths</b> contains the framework’s parent directory</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 id="integration-step2">Step 2: Embed the framework</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Add a new Copy Files build phase to build phases</li>
			<li>Set destination to Frameworks</li>
			<li>Add TvOSPlayerSDK.framework to to list of copied files</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 id="integration-step3">Step 3: Configuring the player with your API-key</h3>
		<p>Before you can create and use an instance of the player you have to configure the lib with your IBM Cloud Video API key:</p>
		<pre>
			<code class="java">
[USUstreamPlayer configureWithApiKey:<place your API key here>];
			</code>
		</pre>
		<h3 id="integaration-step4">Step 4: Creating a player and adding it to your view hierarchy</h3>
		<p>USUstreamPlayer can be instantiated in the usual way using alloc+init or new.
			<br />
			Sample:
		</p>
		<pre>
			<code class="java">
self.ustreamPlayer = [[USUstreamPlayer alloc] init];
self.ustreamPlayer.delegate = self;
self.ustreamPlayer.view.frame = self.view.bounds;
self.ustreamPlayer.view.autoresizingMask = UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleWidth | UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleHeight;
[self.view addSubview:self.ustreamPlayer.view];
			</code>
		</pre>
		<h3 id="integration-step5">Step 5: Start playing content</h3>
		<p>At this point your player is correctly configured and ready to play IBM Cloud Video provided media, USUstreamPlayer is capable to play three different kinds of media:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>live streams using the <b>-[USUstreamPlayer playChannel:]</b> API call.</li>
			<li>recorded videos using the <b>-[USUstreamPlayer playRecorded:]</b> API call.</li>
			<li>highlights using the <b>-[USUstreamPlayer playHighlight:]</b> API call.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Sample:</p>
		<pre>
			<code class="java">
[self.ustreamPlayer playChannel:<place your channel id here>];
			</code>
		</pre>
		<h3 id="introduction-step6">Step 6: Handling callbacks</h3>
		<p>USUstreamPlayer reports its state changes and requires user interaction in case of some locks using the <b>USPlayerDelegate</b> protocol.</br>
		In order to catch these callbacks you have to set a handler conforming to protocol <b>USPlayerDelegate</b> as a delegate of your player instance.</p>
		<p>Sample:</p>
		<pre>
			<code class="java">
self.ustreamPlayer.delegate = self;
			</code>
		</pre>
		<h4>List of Interactive Callbacks</h4>
		<p><b>- (void)playerRequiresPassword:(USUstreamPlayer *)player - </b> When the player sends this callback it waits for a password for the locked content. You can provide the password using <b>continueWithPassword:(NSString *)password</b>. If you provide the password the player validates it and starts playing the content if the password is valid otherwise it calls back again with <b>playerRequiresPassword.</b></p>

		<p><b>- (void)playerRequiresAgeConfirmation:(USUstreamPlayer *)player ageRequired:(NSUInteger)age -</b>When this callback is sent you must ask the user to confirm he is older than the age required. If the user confirms it you can continue the playback with <b>continueWithAgeConfirmed.</b></p>

		<p><b>- (void)playerRequiresBirthdate:(USUstreamPlayer *)player -</b> When this callback is sent you must ask the user to give his/her birthdate in order to check if he/she is old enough to watch the content. You can continue the playback with <b>continueWithBirthdate:(NSDate *)birthdate;</b></p>

		<p><i>Note: Beside these locks there are a number of other, non-interactive locks listed in the appendix. In those cases there is no way to continue the playback.</i></p>

		<p><b>- (void)playerStateDidChange:(USUstreamPlayer *)player -</b> This callback is called whenever the player’s state is changed and allows you to act on it. The possible states are listed in the <b>USPlayerState</b> enum.</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>Customizing the player UI</h2>
		<p>By default <b>USUstreamPlayer</b> comes with a full-featured user interface, including a control bar, loading and error views. This is used if the player’s <b>playerControlStyle</b> property is set to <b>USPlayerControlStyleDefault.</b></p>

		<p>You can change this behaviour by setting the <b>playerControlStyle</b> property of the player.
By setting it to <b>USPlayerControlStyleNone</b> you can instruct the player to present media without any decoration views.</p>

		<p>In case you don’t want to handle all the player states and error cases manually, you can reconfigure the control bars as well, by setting their content using the <b>USUstreamPlayer (USToolbar)</b> category. In order to do so, set the <b>playerControlStyle</b> property to <b>USPlayerControlStyleToolbar.</b></p>

		<p>You can set any of the player toolbar’s contents using the <b>-[USToolbar setToolbarItems:animated:]</b> API. The standard toolbar items are accessible in the <b>USUstreamPlayer (USToolbar)</b> category, and you can create your own items as well by subclassing <b>USToolbarItem.</b></p>

		<h2>Localization</h2>
		<p>IBM Cloud Video provides localizations for all strings used in the IBM Cloud Video Player SDK for tvOS in the following languages:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>English</li>
			<li>Spanish</li>
			<li>Japanese</li>
			<li>Korean</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If you want to provide more languages and/or redefine the texts include the keys listed in appendix into your app’s localization files. If you don’t redefine these keys the SDK will fall back to the localizations included in the SDK’s resource bundle.</p>
