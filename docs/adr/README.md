# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

Read the ADRs in this directory to understand the use and structure of 
markdown files (using YAML Front Matter indexes) published online by 
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

Some of the ADRs include not only the decision (idea) but also specify
what and how to do with examples.


(Don't remove this file as the ADRs include a Jekyll used reference to it.)
