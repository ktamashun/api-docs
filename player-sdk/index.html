		<h4>Introduction</h4>
		<p>The IBM Cloud Video Player SDK lets you play IBM Cloud Video live and recorded videos in your native applications. Using the native SDK gives you full control over the Player, including a customizable native user interface, callbacks on status changes, and many more.</p>
		<p class="note">If you need none of the above, you may use the HTML-based <a href="../player-api/index.html">Player API</a> instead</p>
